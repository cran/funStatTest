    abstract = "{The Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test is a robust competitor of the \\$t\\$ test in the univariate setting. For finite-dimensional multivariate non-Gaussian data, several extensions of the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test have been shown to outperform Hotelling's \\$T^\\{2\\}\\$ test. In this paper, we study a Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney-type test based on spatial ranks in infinite-dimensional spaces, we investigate its asymptotic properties and compare it with several existing tests. The proposed test is shown to be robust with respect to outliers and to have better power than some competitors for certain distributions with heavy tails. We study its performance using real and simulated data.}",

    abstract = {The paper is concerned with inference based on the mean function of a functional time series. We develop a normal approximation for the functional sample mean and then focus on the estimation of the asymptotic variance kernel. Using these results, we develop and asymptotically justify testing procedures for the equality of means in two functional samples exhibiting temporal dependence. Evaluated by means of a simulation study and application to a real data set, these two-sample procedures enjoy good size and power in finite samples.},

    abstract = {Given k independent samples of functional data the problem of testing the null hypothesis of equality of their respective mean functions is considered. So the setting is quite similar to that of the classical one-way anova model but the k samples under study consist of functional data. A simple natural test for this problem is proposed. It can be seen as an asymptotic version of the well-known anova F-test. The asymptotic validity of the method is shown. A numerical Monte Carlo procedure is proposed to handle in practice the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic. A simulation study is included and a real-data example in experimental cardiology is considered in some detail.}
